# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is the boilerplate for the Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator

I completed this calculator on my own and it passes the tests required by FreeCodeCamp. This project showcases my use of numpy arrays.
