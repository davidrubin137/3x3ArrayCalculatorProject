# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is the boilerplate for the Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator

I completed this calculator on my own and it passes the tests required by FreeCodeCamp. This project showcases my use of numpy arrays. 

"mean_var_std" file contains the code for the calculator. "test_module" contains FreeCodeCamp's tests to verify that the calculator works as planned. "main" runs the calculator along with the tests.
